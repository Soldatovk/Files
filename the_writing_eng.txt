When the holidays came, I was very happy!
The weather was good, so my friends and I went for a walk almost every day.
It was fun! Then I spent a month in the city of Pyatigorsk, where my beloved grandmother lives.
That was great. I ate a lot of delicious food that my grandmother cooked for me.
Every day at 18:00 I went to the sports ground where I did various physical exercises.
Then I attended an event where they showed robots and new technologies.
After my arrival from my grandmother, I sat at the computer and watched YouTube videos on the topic of programming.
I learned something new for myself, and taught my sister to write code in python.
It was cool! I really enjoyed my holidays.
